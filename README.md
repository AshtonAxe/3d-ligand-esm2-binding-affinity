# Cross-Attention-of-3D-Drug-Geometry-and-ESM2-Protein-Embeddings-for-Binding-Affinity-Prediction
Integrates a 3D ligand GNN with ESM-2 protein embeddings through multi-head cross-attention to predict binding affinity. Model achieved 1.05 pKi RMSE on BindingDB pairs with far more lightweight pipeline than DeepAtom (1.23 pKi RMSE on PDBbind)
